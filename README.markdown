# How to build

In order to view this essay in its full glory it needs to be parsed by a markdown parser supporting footnotes. (GitHub Flavored Markdown does not enable footnotes)

Examples would be [kramdown][], [MultiMarkdown][] or [Discount][].

The simplest way would be to install [pandoc][] and run `make`.
