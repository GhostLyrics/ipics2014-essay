[In his words: How a whitehat hacked a university and became an FBI target][1] by **Sean Gallagher** - It can be rather frustrating pointing out a critical vulnerability and seeing nothing done in return. Ill be rather open that the mail he wrote struck me as sounding hostile but staying put wouldnt have made this any better either.

[Russia Quietly Tightens Reins on Web With Bloggers Law][2] by **Neil MacFarquhar**

> Yet polls conducted in 24 countries last spring by Pew Research found that most people are against government censorship of the Internet, including 63 percent in Russia and 58 percent in Turkey.

> Punishments start at fines that can reach up to $142,000 or the temporary closing of the blog, if the law is actively enforced. 

In other words: Pay an fee which is out of reach for many people or shut the fuck down.

> On the one hand, the Russian government says the Russian people are the best. On the other hand, it doesnt trust the people. 

Of course not. Which government does? I am willing to guess that the German saying 'Trust is good, monitoring is better' was coined by a government official too.

[Programming sucks][3] by **Peter Welch** tells you why programming is not a job so much better than your current one. Stress, puzzle parts not fitting together and general insanity of software development are highlighted in this piece. If you have any experience developing you are going to be both laughing and crying at the same time.

You may want to read about the other side of that argument in [What programming is like][4] by **Sam Stokes**. He will tell you about the good sides of development, the ones where you build LEGO castles without ever running out of the blocks you want. The most important thing to remember is that while software developers complain about their tools, they tend to forget that it is within their reach to improve them or even create better ones.

Another post by **Peter Welch** worth reading is [Job Advice][5] in which he describes his past and prensent career in a delightfully humorous way. He gives some advice but to be honest I recommend this article mainly due to its amusing tone.

Is Markdown our current answer for well formatted writing with little distraction? I can say that with certainty for myself and many others seem to think so too. [The Markdown Payoff][9] is an examination of his writing process before and after switching to Markdown by **Hilton Lipschitz**.

**Troy Hunt** writes about how bad eBay's password advices are in [The eBay breach: answers to the questions that will inevitably be asked][10]. I've encountered that form myself when changing my password and found myself cursing without end. Not only had they disabled pasting ([which is bad][11]) but also the form complained about me using space characters in my password. I assure you, there were none.
