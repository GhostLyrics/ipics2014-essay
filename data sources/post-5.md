Since I skipped the last two month, this will be a longer post, summarizing both May, June and July 2014, probably even some entries from August, just so they're written down somewhere.

## Games

  * [Guild Wars 2][1] - Got back to GW2, had a lot of fun, found new guild members, almost finished the story, joined the living story, did fractals, conquered dungeons, crafted. I'm playing it on a Windows partition since the Mac Beta client is still lacking in terms of performance. Honestly, I expect it to stay this way, being powered by [Wine][2] under the hood.
  * [Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, Freedom Cry][3] - gameplay wise there are little changes; however, its music is exceptional even for an Assassin's Creed game. I bought [the official soundtrack][4] on its (delayed) release day.
  * [Assassin's Creed Revelations][5] - Played again, as part of our companion gaming. I thought about visiting Cappadocia.
  * [Assassin's Creed 3][6] - Got it as a gift from a good friend. Have not yet finished it. Often I found myself tuning out when Connor was talking his native language. In contrast to an Italian or Turkish accent it was not that relatable, especially when more than half of a dialogue was not in English. The game itself is huge. I haven't seen everything yet but I'm already impressed by the sheer scale of the game world and the variety of activities implemented. It does not suffer from _TES IV: Oblivion syndrome_ though, where each and every thing is more interesting than the main quest itself.
  * [Mass Effect 2][7] - A quick game and a few missions to entertain the girlfriend who has yet to see the story of ME2 and was bored with the ME1 Let's Play she watched.
  * [Road Not Taken][8] - Impulse buy after having watched the [expert video playthrough][9] on [its Steam page][10]. The game is adorable, challenging, yet not frustrating. I find it a lot of fun to play. Randomly generated puzzles are a nice idea.

## Novels

  * [Klteschlaf][11] by [Arnaldur indriason][12] (German, iTunes Promotion) - **MISS**
  * [Night School. Du darfst keinem trauen][13] by [C.J. Daugherty][14] (German, Amazon Promotion) - **MISS**
  * [Du mich auch: Ein Rache-Roman][15] by [Ellen Berg][16] (German, Amazon Promotion) - **HIT**
  * [No Plot? No Problem!][17] by [Chris Baty][18] - Another recommendation from [Stefan][19], due to me being a lazy writer, blogger and author. Great read even if you're not planning to participate in a [NaNoWriMo][20].
  * [The Swift Programming Language][21] by Apple - Had only a cursory look into this yet and toyed around with Playgrounds. I found the graphing of changing variables a great help for visualizing data while experimenting.

### The Book of Deacon series

I came across The Book of Deacon as promotion from [the Story Bundle][22] newsletter and was curious. It has a rich fantasy universe which is not too far off and caught me with its interesting characters - enough that I bought both the remaining books of the trilogy as well as the additional ones set in the same universe. The author of this series is [Joseph Lallo][23].

### The Witcher series

The Witcher is something I love to talk about even considering that I didn't like the first video game. I have not yet tried the second and the third has not yet been released. Some years ago I was in Cologne at the [Role Playing Convention][29] when I noticed the author was also there due to a promotion. They sold games with a map which I wanted to have but I already owned the game and asked if it was possible for me to purchase a copy of the book with the map. It was possible and I still have both map and book - even with the author's signature on it.

I bought the last book of the series some years ago as a paperback novel however I never really took the time to re-read the complete series. Recently I was abroad for a period of time and bought all the books again as ebooks. Being able to read them whenever I wanted without lugging the whole seven books with me on the plane helped me read them again. I enjoy the Witcher universe which was created by [Andrzej Sapkowski][30]. It's a pity the first game's combat makes me cringe every time I need to rhythmically click enemies to death.

## Podcasts

I started using [Overcast][38] without its IAP since I wanted to see whether I really need a third-party podcatcher to replace Apple's one. _Also, I tend to like [Marco's][39] apps, so I needed to try this one too._

## Movies

  * [Maleficent][44] - We rarely go to the cinema, mainly due to me complaining about other people and not liking movies a lot. After this visit I could add another point to that list of negative impressions: Along with the movie we watched we were forced to watch about 14 ads. _14_. That's almost the same amount we paid in Euro for the tickets for both of me and my girlfriend combined. **You should watch this movie though.** It's interesting, fairly well done and not being overly kitschy. I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie either but the overall impression was very positive.
