**Summary: 5 games, 2 novels, 1 movie, 11 videos, 1 podcast.**

## Games

  * [Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood][1] - Finished again; no point in trying 100% completion again after having it synced to AC Initiates before though. Saved me a lot of nerves.
  * [Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood: The Da Vinci Disappearance][2] - It was nice to play some content I've not seen before when replaying the series with my girlfriend to show her the full story of Assassin's Creed. The Da Vinci Disappearance was refreshing and exciting. It even surpassed my expectations, having read the story before. The presentation is superb and includes elements which made for an enjoyable change of pace from the main game.
  * [FTL: Faster Than Light][3] - Impulse buy after having watched [its overview video][3]. Fun, but very hard. I'm playing on _Easy_ with _Advanced Content On_ but wasn't able to finish it once yet. Incidentally I made an acquaintance last week who also happened to play it on the iPad and has not yet managed to finish it either.
  * [Secret Files: Tunguska][4] - Love the series. Tunguska is our current Companion Gaming title.
  * [Pokmon Y][5] - Picked up Pokmon for a day to swap pokmon with a relative over the holidays.

## Novels

  * [Killer Frost][6] by [Jennifer Estep][7] - A fitting end to a wonderful series. Delighting, amusing and extremely satisfying. Will look into the author's other series. I have also downloaded another in-between story that's currently only available [in German on iTunes for free][8].
  * [No Plot? No Problem!][9] by [Chris Baty][10] - a book about hints and helpful procedures for aspiring novelists which intend to take on the challenge of [NaNoWriMo][11]. I'm not yet sold on the concept of writing extensively for only one month, but on the other hand I do indeed have the tendency to keep a lot of projects just lingering around when I should be dedicating them enough time and motivation to finish them. The book was recommended to me by [Stefan][12].  
I'm not yet finished with the book as of the time of this writing.

## Videos and movies

I watched [Madagascar][13] in German. Didn't like it. I liked last holiday's [Puss in Boots][14] a lot better.

## Podcasts

  * Directional 6 - [Paper Manuals][26]

Listened to an episode of [Directional][27] because I read a lot of the articles [@viticci][28] writes, but wasn't particularly entertained.
