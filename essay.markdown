# Introduction

We live in a world in which seemingly everything is connected. We freely, globally share personal information which would be only known to a small circle of friends in former times. We give up control over some of our data each and every day.

A terrifying amount of this data is easily available online to an attacker and can be used to create a frighteningly exact profile of a person. Often it doesn't even take a lot of effort, knowlegdge or experience to harvest said information.

There are, however those who have mastered the usage of such information: black hat hackers, law enforcement services and secret services.
The term that has been coined for collecting this kind of freely accessible intelligence is "Open-source intelligence" [^usnews-opensource]. This term is commonly abbreviated as "OSINT".
