# Introduction

We live in a world in which seemingly everything is connected. We freely, globally share personal information which would be only known to a small circle of friends in former times. We give up control over some of our data each and every day.

A terrifying amount of this data is easily available online to an attacker and can be used to create a frighteningly exact profile of a person. Often it doesn't even take a lot of effort, knowlegdge or experience to harvest said information.

There are, however those who have mastered the usage of such information: black hat hackers, law enforcement services and secret services.
The term that has been coined for collecting this kind of freely accessible intelligence is "Open-source intelligence" [^usnews-opensource]. This term is commonly abbreviated as "OSINT".

[^usnews-opensource]: ["Spy Agencies Turn to Newspapers, NPR, and Wikipedia for Information", U.S. News](http://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/09/12/spy-agencies-turn-to-newspapers-npr-and-wikipedia-for-information)

## Typical components of OSINT

### Data Mining

>**data mining**: (noun, Digital Technology) the process of collecting, searching through, and analyzing a large amount of data in a database, as to discover patterns or relationships [^dictionary-data_mining]

[^dictionary-data_mining]: [Definition of "data mining", Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/data%20mining?s=t)

When data mining is mentioned in the context of open source intelligence, there's a good chance someone will be referring to analyzing data sources like IRC logs, Twitter, Open Data sources, archives of mailing-lists, public Facebook and Google+ profiles. This is just the tip of the iceberg. That I just did this enumartion without any research acts as a good reminder how easy it is to find open sources. There are more sources to OSINT this document aims to shed light on.

### Link analysis

>**link analysis**: Link analysis is a subset of network analysis, exploring associations between objects. An example may be examining the addresses of suspects and victims, the telephone numbers they have dialed and financial transactions that they have partaken in during a given timeframe, and the familial relationships between these subjects as a part of police investigation. [^wikipedia-link-analysis]

[^wikipedia-link-analysis]: [Network theory, section "network analysis", subsection "link analysis", Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory#Link_analysis)

As you can easily see from above quote taken straight from wikipedia, link analysis has been an important tool in investigating crimes long before the advent of computers and the current difficult situation with users' privacy concerning the data their device produce daily. Modern technology has only made this easier by giving researchers more different sources of information. Those sources often contain many more records than they did before efforts on standardization and globalization of data had reached their current scale.

One needs only look at the TV series "Numb3rs" [^imdb-numbers] which aired several years ago from the time of this writing to see the great benefit scientific methods can have on crime investigation. Now, one must not assume that the show is to be taken for truth - it's a product of fiction of course. It is mentioned here not as an example how these investigations are pursued but to illustrate how much development of methods can help investigators. For example, the technique called "cellphone triangulation" which is both used (in combination with other technologies) to allow smartphones to provide their current location to running applications and by law enforcement when looking for missing persons. Also reknown mathematics company Wolfram partnered with the production company CBS to promote math awareness via the series. [^wolfram-numbers]
