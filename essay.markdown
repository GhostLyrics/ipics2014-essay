# Introduction

We live in a world in which seemingly everything is connected. We freely, globally share personal information which would be only known to a small circle of friends in former times. We give up control over some of our data each and every day.

A terrifying amount of this data is easily available online to an attacker and can be used to create a frighteningly exact profile of a person. Often it doesn't even take a lot of effort, knowlegdge or experience to harvest said information.

There are, however those who have mastered the usage of such information: black hat hackers, law enforcement services and secret services.
The term that has been coined for collecting this kind of freely accessible intelligence is "Open-source intelligence" [^usnews-opensource]. This term is commonly abbreviated as "OSINT".

## Typical components of OSINT

### Data Mining

>**data mining**: (noun, Digital Technology) the process of collecting, searching through, and analyzing a large amount of data in a database, as to discover patterns or relationships [^dictionary-data_mining]

[^dictionary-data_mining]: [Definition of "data mining", Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/data%20mining?s=t)

When data mining is mentioned in the context of open source intelligence, there's a good chance someone will be referring to analyzing data sources like IRC logs, Twitter, Open Data sources, archives of mailing-lists, public Facebook and Google+ profiles. This is just the tip of the iceberg. That I just did this enumartion without any research acts as a good reminder how easy it is to find open sources. There are more sources to OSINT this document aims to shed light on.
